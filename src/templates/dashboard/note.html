  <p>
    This portfolio is a work-in-progress. I’m still new to designing and showcasing my work, so some features aren’t fully added yet. 
    The projects section may contain placeholder data, and a few bugs might still be floating around.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently building this while preparing for my exams — so updates are rolling out gradually.
    That said, if you're interested, I highly recommend checking my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayyan-aqil-4a1a95195/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/rayyan22207" target="_blank">GitHub</a> first. If you’d like to continue, feel free to request my resume or message me directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ll be adding a proper contact form and other enhancements soon — including better design and real project integration.
    Thanks for your patience, and thank you for stopping by.
