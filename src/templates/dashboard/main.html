  <h1>Name: Rayyan Aqil</h1>
  <p>
    Occupation: Software Developer<br>
    I build backend systems, automate workflows, and turn ideas into functional, scalable software products.

<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Rayyan — a self-taught developer based in Pakistan, with 3+ years of experience working on real-world systems,
    internal business tools, and micro SaaS products.
  </p>
  <p>
    My core strengths lie in backend development, system design, API creation, and automation.
    I'm most comfortable in Python (especially Django), Firebase, and Flutter. I’ve also worked with
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, WebSockets, and deployment platforms like Railway and Render.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a strong problem solver, prefer clean and modular code, and like building things that actually work
    rather than just look pretty.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, I’ll be honest — I’m not a designer. UI/UX and frontend design aren’t my strong suits,
    though I can work with Tailwind, basic HTML/CSS, and Flutter widgets when needed.
    I usually compensate by keeping things simple, functional, and minimal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of code, I'm usually experimenting with new ideas — from useful internal tools to fun, ambitious builds. 
    I’m currently working on several personal projects, many of which are micro SaaS products that aren’t open-sourced yet. 
    Alongside those, I’ve explored things like ethical malware concepts, a Jarvis-style AI assistant, and a bunch of other creative experiments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually, I plan to launch a blog or updates page to share what I’m working on in real-time. 
    For now, this portfolio is just a glimpse into what I’ve done — and who I am.

<section id="personality">
  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>
    I’m logical, independent, and very detail-focused. I like getting things done and often work fast once I’m in flow.
    I prefer deep work over multitasking, and I value clarity and structure in both code and communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also tend to overbuild at times — I like adding features or polishing systems beyond what’s strictly required.
    Sometimes I take on too many ideas at once, so I’m learning to slow down and prioritize better.
  </p>
